# StoreManager Multi-Threaded Test Suite

This directory contains a comprehensive test suite for validating the thread-safety of the StoreManager implementation. The tests simulate concurrent access to the StoreManager from multiple threads, stressing different aspects of its behavior.

## Test Structure

The tests use a shared StoreManager instance across all test functions, which helps to better simulate a real-world environment where a single manager handles all concurrent operations.

### Key Files

- `test_utils.go`: Contains utility functions and the shared StoreManager setup
- `concurrent_test.go`: Basic concurrent operations tests (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- `parametrized_test.go`: Tests with varying numbers of threads to assess scalability
- `race_patterns_test.go`: Tests specific multi-threaded patterns (readers-writers, producer-consumer)
- `shared_instance_test.go`: Validates that all tests use the same StoreManager instance
- `comprehensive_test.go`: Combined test suite that runs multiple patterns in a sequence

## Test Patterns

The test suite covers several important concurrent access patterns:

1. **Basic Concurrent Operations**: Multiple threads performing GET, PUT, DELETE operations on overlapping keys
2. **Increment Operations**: Threads performing read-modify-write operations (critical sections)
3. **String Manipulation**: Concurrent string append operations
4. **High Contention**: Multiple threads all operating on the same key
5. **Read-Write Pattern**: Multiple readers accessing data alongside writers
6. **Producer-Consumer Pattern**: Threads producing data while others consume it
7. **High Frequency Operations**: Maximum load testing with rapid operations

## Expected Results

Many of the tests are expected to fail in the current implementation because StoreManager lacks proper synchronization for complex operations like increments (which require GET-then-PUT). The tests failing properly indicate that our test suite is correctly detecting race conditions.

However, the tests show that basic operations like individual GETs, PUTs, and DELETEs work correctly even under heavy concurrent load.

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test -v ./storemanager

# Run a specific test
go test -v ./storemanager -run TestConcurrentOperations

# Run the comprehensive test suite
go test -v ./storemanager -run TestSharedComprehensive
```

## Performance Metrics

The test suite also measures performance metrics:

- Operations per second
- Thread utilization
- Execution time
- Final store size

## Next Steps

The test results indicate that the StoreManager implementation needs proper synchronization for handling operations that require atomicity (like increments). This can be achieved by:

1. Adding lock mechanisms for critical sections
2. Implementing atomic operations for common patterns like increments
3. Supporting transactional operations that need to be atomic
